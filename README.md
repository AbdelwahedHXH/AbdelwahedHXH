### 👋 Hi! I am Abdelwahed

💡  I like to explore new technologies and develop software solutions.

🎓  I'm currently studying ICT engineering at The Higher school of communication of Tunis "SUP'COM".

😍 I’ve always been interested in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and internet of things (IoT). 
I enjoy developing ML pipelines, preparing data for training, testing algorithms, running metrics, and deriving key performance at scale to solve data science challenges and to improve the performance of various IoT systems.

📄 I'm open to any feedbacks, suggestions and offers!
